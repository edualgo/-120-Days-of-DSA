Edualgo Academy is a small startup, focused on building a learner-centric, research-based education curriculum. Complexities are everywhere, but only a good teacher can simplify those complexities and make them learner specific. We try to provide quality content, mentorship and related resources at a cheaper price. Quality is taken quite seriously at our place.

Education is becoming a business, although teaching is a profession, it's becoming a money madness. Even if some companies are delivering good resources, they are making it overpriced and available for a limited duration of time. Instead of limiting the learner's appetite, the cheapest price & better quality makes us stand apart from others.
